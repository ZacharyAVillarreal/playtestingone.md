**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
There was no tutorial or explaination at the begining of the game as to what to do. At first I was a little confused and just messed with the few interactable objects in the game and as I played I noticed in the items menu game you a description of what could be done to improve the shelter and the people.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
No, from the hour long session I played of the beginning I did not notice anything useless or unneccesary. Everything I had was shown to have an effect and use.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
The game is not balanced and the player feels starved of resources and constantly needs more materials. The game is meant to feel this way though, you are playing as a survivor in an on goinging war and you are scraping by just to leave with your other group members.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
The pacing of this game feels right for this style of game. The game is meant to be slow and each moment meaningful. If the game had immediate action and was fast pace then the game would feel weird but the pacing seems just right and keeps the player interested with story and resource management. 

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
Yes, each action took time and I only had a few hours to get everything done and with the amount of components I had I always felt I needed more and if I just had a few more I do what I needed. 

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
The was enjoyable, I do not regret playing the game and may even go back to it at sometime, but the pacing of the game and the style of game in which it is, is not my favorite. All in all, I thought the atmosphere and overall gameplay was fun.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
The only gameplay issue I had was if I tabbed out of the game and went to another window, the game would sometimes crash. It did not happen everytime, but maybe one out of three times I tabbed out, the game would crash.
